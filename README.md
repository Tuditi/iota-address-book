# IOTA  Wallet

This is an example for an IOTA Address Book based on Svelte, TypeScript and Electron.
The application is capable of managing a list of IOTA Addresses and their balances at time of addition.

In the future, live reload of addresses will be supported.

Prerequisites:
  - Node: 14.16.0+

```
